# Native-Language-Model
Edge Intelligence: creating a native keyword model


This project is being designed to create a native Nigerian language Alexa I call Apeke, at the time of creating this readme I mistakenly deleted the official dataset that I spent about 2 weeks gathering, yet to gather another round of data.
If this project does interest you in any way feel free to contribute.
